# Student Intervention System
This project is a binary classification problem. I have used three datascience models here:
1. Logistic Regression
2. KNeighbors Classifier (K=20)
3. Naive Bayes  
Feel free to use this code for your advantage.
###### How to use this code?
This is a Jupyter Notebook file so you must have Jupyter Notebook installed.  
Also download the student-data.csv and edit the path to this .csv file in the code.
