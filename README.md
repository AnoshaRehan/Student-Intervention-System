# Student Intervention System
This project is a binary classification problem. I have used three machine learning models here:
1. Logistic Regression
2. KNeighbors Classifier (K=20)
3. Naive Bayes  
Feel free to use this code to your advantage.
## The Datascience process?
1. Retreiving data
2. Preparing data
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Data modelling
5. Choosing the best model

###### How to use this code?
This is a Jupyter Notebook file so you must have Jupyter Notebook installed.  
Also download the student-data.csv and edit the path to this .csv file in the code.
